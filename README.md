## Projects

I'm always working on new and exciting projects. Here are a few of my starred repositories that you might find interesting:

- [Advanced Node-Express Skeleton](https://github.com/ricardo774-774/rest-api-express/tree/6.0.0-socket-chat): This is an advanced skeleton of a project in nodejs and express, with complete cruds and many interesting sections like: JWT Creation Logs with google account Validations Searches from db Etc.
- [Weather Console App](https://github.com/ricardo774-774/console-weather-nodejs): This is a project created with nodejs. It's basically a place finder, you can enter a place in the console and the console show you a layer of places with these characters in the word you entered, also shows the weather of that place with many related data, finally also keeps a record of the last 5 places entered. For this it uses 2 external apis.
- [Set Web Apps](https://github.com/ricardo774-774/Web-Proyects-JS): Set of individual and different projects in which websites are developed with HTML, CSS and JS. Each of them has a totally different purpose (the others, the last ones are the most "advanced")

Feel free to explore my repositories and see what I've been working on.
